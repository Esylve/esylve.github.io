# Howdy! 

Looks like you found my github. To be honest, I don't really use it much outside of Hackathons and group projects, but while you're here feel free to look around. You'll probably find yourself looking at a bunch of tiny, broken snippets of code, but it's all part my learning process. If you want to see more of my "learning process," you can also find some snippets on [my codepen] (codepen.io/esylve)

The best place to find accurate information on my experience and skills is right on this very project. To navigate to my portfolio, visit [https://esylve.github.io](https://esylve.github.io).
